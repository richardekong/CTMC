This project analyzes the availability of an IaaS cloud model through Continuous Time Markov Chains. It uses the generated model from the analysis to generate availability and downtime data, and facilitates the subsequent write and read of the generated data to an excel file. Availability and Downtime level data can also be visualized in either 2 or 3 dimensional plots.
