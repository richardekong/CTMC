This project analyzes the availability of an IaaS cloud model through Continuous Time Markov Chains. It uses the generated model of from the analysis to generate availability and downtime data, and facilitates the subsequent saving and loading of the generated data. Availability and Downtime level data can also be visualized in either 2 or 3 dimensional plots.
